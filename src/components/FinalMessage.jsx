                Even now, when I think of you ‚Äî it's never with anger. It's
                always with warmth. Your laughter, your innocence, the way you
                made ordinary days feel special ‚Äî all of that still stays with
                me.
                <br />
                <br />
                No matter where life takes us, you'll always be one of the most
                beautiful chapters of my story. A chapter that changed me,
                taught me, and made me feel what real love truly means.
                <br />
                <br />
                We never hugged each other, neither held each other's hand. So
                much remained incomplete, so many moments left unshared. There's
                a part of me that will always wonder what it would have felt
                like to hold you close, to feel your hand in mine.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm not there with you today, can't stand by your side, can't
                give you gifts or celebrate with you in person. That's why I
                created this - the only way I could express everything I feel,
                everything you mean to me. I hope it reaches your heart the way
                you've touched mine.

                In 2022, my eyes first found you there,{"\n"}A quiet soul, with
                a gentle stare.{"\n"}
                Your silence spoke more than words could say,{"\n"}
                And slowly, our friendship paved the way.{"\n\n"}
                On June 14th, I opened my heart,{"\n"}
                Scared and trembling, not knowing where to start.{"\n"}A
                confession I carried, heavy and true,{"\n"}
                Every beat whispered‚Äîit belongs to you.{"\n\n"}
                The first proposal broke me apart,{"\n"}
                Your "no" carved silence deep in my heart.{"\n"}
                But fate was kind, and in September's embrace,{"\n"}
                We found commitment, love's sweetest place.{"\n\n"}
                On December 8th, our first photo was made,{"\n"}A memory
                eternal, that will never fade.{"\n"}
                Two smiles together, captured in time,{"\n"}A priceless
                moment‚Äîforever mine.{"\n\n"}
                Every touch, so gentle, so real,{"\n"}
                Brought a warmth no words could conceal.{"\n"}
                After our fights, my soul would crave,{"\n"}
                Your voice, your presence‚Äîthe comfort I'd save.{"\n\n"}
                When your call never came, my nights felt long,{"\n"}
                The silence heavy, the absence strong.{"\n"}
                My friends still ask, they speak your name,{"\n"}
                And I feel the pride, the love, the flame.{"\n\n"}
                You were the first I felt proud to show,{"\n"}
                To my family, with a heart aglow.{"\n"}
                And each time you built something bright and true,{"\n"}
                The joy was mine, in watching you.{"\n\n"}
                But love's path isn't always kind,{"\n"}
                Jealousy lingered, clouding the mind.{"\n"}
                Little fights, words left unsaid,{"\n"}
                Turned warmth into distance, love into dread.{"\n\n"}
                Hurt followed close, cutting so deep,{"\n"}
                Scars in the heart that quietly we keep.{"\n"}
                And slowly the silence grew too strong,{"\n"}A bond once
                unbreakable started to go wrong.{"\n\n"}
                Now we stand apart, with stories untold,{"\n"}
                Hearts once burning, now quiet and cold.{"\n"}
                Yet still in my chest, your memory stays,{"\n"}
                Guiding my nights, coloring my days.{"\n\n"}
                Shivani, no matter the distance we bear,{"\n"}A part of me will
                always be there.{"\n"}
                My story began the moment I found you,{"\n"}
                And even in silence‚Äîmy love is true.{"\n\n"}
                You Were My Peace, You Were My Chaos{"\n\n"}
                The day we met, it wasn't ordinary,{"\n"}
                Your smile felt warm, your eyes felt merry.{"\n"}
                From that moment, I knew somehow,{"\n"}
                You'd matter to me ‚Äî then, now, and how.{"\n\n"}
                Your innocence made me care so deep,{"\n"}
                Every word you said, my heart would keep.{"\n"}I worried for
                you, your gentle soul,{"\n"}
                Afraid this world might take its toll.{"\n\n"}I guided you,
                taught you to grow,{"\n"}
                To stand for yourself, to let them know.{"\n"}
                Sometimes I went too close, too near,{"\n"}
                You scolded me once ‚Äî I still hear.{"\n\n"}
                That evening we talked, like nothing went wrong,{"\n"}
                And from that day, our bond grew strong.{"\n"}
                We stayed together, through laugh and pain,{"\n"}
                Through sunshine moments and sudden rain.{"\n\n"}
                Then came June 14th, the day of truth,{"\n"}
                When I confessed, with trembling youth.{"\n"}
                You smiled ‚Äî the world froze still,{"\n"}
                My heart bowed down to your will.{"\n\n"}
                Then September 19th marked our vow,{"\n"}A promise of forever ‚Äî
                I still keep somehow.{"\n"}
                And December 8th, our first pic in frame,{"\n"}A moment eternal,
                beyond just a name.{"\n\n"}
                We fought sometimes, my words turned cold,{"\n"}
                But your silence ‚Äî that's what hurt the most.{"\n"}
                When your call didn't come, I'd stare at the phone,{"\n"}
                Feeling every second, painfully alone.{"\n\n"}
                My friends still ask about you today,{"\n"}
                And I just smile ‚Äî what can I say?{"\n"}
                You were the one I felt proud to show,{"\n"}
                To my home, my heart ‚Äî where few could go.{"\n\n"}
                Every time you achieved something new,{"\n"}
                It filled me with joy, proud of you.{"\n"}
                You were the only one I felt so secure,{"\n"}
                My peace, my reason, my heart's cure.{"\n\n"}
                The touch, the warmth, the way you'd stay,{"\n"}
                Those moments still don't fade away.{"\n"}
                And even if time made us drift apart,{"\n"}
                You still live quietly inside my heart.
